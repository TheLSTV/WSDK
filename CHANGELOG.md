- Misc tools like database benchmark added
- Migrated to a different DB system, only to add automatic saving instead of intervals, but the performance and disk space waste may have worsened. There may be a way to switch later.
- Polished treeview - now sadly due to the changes the connector lines have been temporarily removed, but more features have been added and more like virtual scrolling optimisation are awaiting.
